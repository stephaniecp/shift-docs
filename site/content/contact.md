Shift is a loose volunteer-organized crew.  Most discussion about things like the content on the website, organizational issues, and events takes place on the [mailing list](https://lists.riseup.net/www/info/shift) which you're encouraged but not required to join.  

Shift also maintains a small presence on social media:

- [Shift facebook](https://www.facebook.com/shift2bikes/) isn't super active.
- [Pedalpalooza facebook](https://www.facebook.com/pedalpalooza/) has a lot more activity - mostly in June during [pedalpalooza](/pages/pedalpalooza).
- [Pedalpalooza twitter](https://twitter.com/pedalpalooza) is also pretty active in June

If you want to get in touch with folks about these specific projects, you'll probably get the fastest response via their own channels:

- **[PDX World Naked Bike Ride](https://pdxwnbr.org/contact/)** (website contact form)
- **[Breakfast on the Bridges](/pages/bonb)** has a [mailing list](mailto:bonb@lists.riseup.net).
- **[(Portland area) Move by Bike](/pages/mxb)** has a [https://www.facebook.com/groups/movebybike/](facebook page).
- **[web calendar developers](shift_hackathon@googlegroups.com)** (mailing list)
