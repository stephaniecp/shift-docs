Shift welcomes all respectful participants!  There are a lot of ways to get involved:

- join a ride [from our calendar](https://shift2bikes.org/cal).  You may want to read some suggestions for enjoying your ride in [this comic](/images/ride_riding_comic.png).

- help lead a ride!  Ride leaders are almost always looking for help in crowd management - sweeping, corking, helping get folks' attention when it's time to ride out.  If you can find the leader before a ride starts, ask if they need help!

- [lead your own ride](/pages/lead-a-ride)!

- volunteer:
  - help [edit and create content for this website](https://github.com/Shift2Bikes/shift-docs#contributing)! This process is written up in [more detail on this page](/pages/website-development) - we especially need authors (who need no particular tech skills), and designers to help style this website.
  - help with [the calendar](http://shift2bikes.org/cal) - See [this page](https://github.com/Shift2Bikes/shiftcal#how-to-setup--run-locally) for some more details.
  - help facilitate events like [pedalpalooza](/pages/pedalpalooza).  Join the [shift volunteers mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/shift-volunteers) and let us know what dreams and/or skills you've got.  We need folks to help edit the calendar, encourage folks to create events, help with social media, etc.
  - post related content on our [social media channels](/pages/contact).  Want a more formal role like moderating our page or tweeting for us?  Ping the [shift volunteers mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/shift-volunteers) and we'll chat with you about how you can help.
  - help with [Breakfast on the Bridges](/pages/bonb).
  - help with [the World Naked Bike Ride](https://pdxwnbr.org/volunteer/)

- donate!  The paypal button at the bottom of the page here lets you give a tax deductible donation to shift via our fiscal sponsor Umbrella.  You can see how we use this money on our [expenses page](/pages/boring-budget-stuff).
